            <h2>About Egypt</h2>
            <p className="det">
            The area of ​​Egypt is located in North-East Africa and partly on the Sinai 
            Peninsula in Asia. Egypt is adjacent to countries such as  Sudan  (south),  
            Libya  (west) and  Israel  (east). 
            The territory of the republic was divided into 4 regions: the Western Desert, 
            the Arabian Desert (Eastern), the Delta and the Nile Valley and the Sinai 
            Peninsula. The Nile is the only river that crosses Egypt, it is 6671 km long. 
            Important regions are the valley and the delta of the Nile, they are the smallest of the separated regions, 
            but their population is 98% of the country's population.

            Egypt has an extremely dry tropical climate. 
            The annual amount of precipitation generally does not exceed several dozen millimeters.
             So, most of the population lives in the delta and valley of the Nile. 
             There is a riverside oasis by the river, 
             the length of which is less than 3,000 km. kilometers. 
             Thousands of years ago, an artificial irrigation system was created in Egypt,
              significantly increasing the area of ​​​​cultivated land. 
              The irrigation system was expanded in 1970, 
              when a water dam (Great Dam) was built, 
              an artificial reservoir (Lake Nasser) and a hydroelectric power plant were built in Aswan.

            <p className="det">
            The desert climate in Egypt makes the flora very poor. 
            Lush vegetation is restricted to the valley and delta
           The Nile and cities that are characterized by green urban spaces.
            </p>
            <p className="det">
            There is a great variety of animals in Egypt. 
            Species such as the deer and mountain sheep live there,
             which can only be found in a small area of ​​southwestern Egypt. 
             In the desert, there are species typical of this region, 
             such as the desert bird and the desert fox. 
             Scorpions are also common.
              Dangerous animals  in Egypt include spotted snakes and cobras
              living in agricultural areas. Rodents are considered a pest in Egypt
           They multiply at a fast pace. There are also about 150 species
             of birds in Egypt.
